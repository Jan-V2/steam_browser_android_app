# steam_browser_android_app
This is an app allows you download and sort all of the ongoing sales on steam.com.
It allows you to sort and filter ongoing sales in ways the site won't let you.
The goal is to let users find the best sales in the steam store.

it requires this as the backend https://github.com/johnvanderholt/steamsale_app_backend 
The backend scrapes steam.com and gathers all the on sale items and some related info (old price, new price, discount percentate, ect.).
The app downloads a compressed version of this info, and allows the user to sort and filter it, in ways the site won't let you.

This project is complete and working, but hasn't been updated in a long time. 
it probalbly no longer builds, but if you have a use for it feel free to use it according to gpl2.
